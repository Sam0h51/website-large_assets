This repository captures content that is part of the deal.II homepage and/or the 
deal.II documentation, but that consists of static large files that we do not want to 
distribute along with the deal.II source files. Examples include pictures and
movies that are part of the deal.II tutorial programs, or preprints and
publications that document specific versions of deal.II. All of these form
part of the general documentation of the library, but are not usefully
included in the downloadable .tar.gz files for deal.II for their size and
static nature.
